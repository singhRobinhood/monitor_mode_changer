# monitor_mode_changer
This python script will allows you to change into monitor mode and managed mode in single click, no need to press multiple lines of commands in terminal. If you're not able to change into monitor mode this is a great script. The commands used are for the linux, debian only. And if you don't want to "airmon-ng check kill" put a '#' before the line in the script. 

After switching to monitor mode press in terminal --> service NetworkManager restart

Note: Use python3 and don't have then replace all the "input" to "raw_input".
